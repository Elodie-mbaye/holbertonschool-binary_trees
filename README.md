# Binary trees ✏️

## Synopsis

A binary tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children called left child and right child. It can be visualized as a hierarchical structure where the topmost node is called root node and the bottom nodes are called leaf nodes.


## What we learned in this project:

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
